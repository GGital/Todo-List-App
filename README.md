# Todo-List-App
## **Project Overview**
Managing tasks efficiently is a growing challenge in today’s fast-paced world. Traditional methods like sticky notes and basic planners often lack flexibility, prioritization, and reminder features, leading to missed deadlines and reduced productivity.

This ToDo Application offers a simple yet powerful solution to create, organize, and track tasks effectively.
